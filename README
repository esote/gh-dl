gh-dl is a client to download all public GitHub repositories from users and/or
organizations to create a compressed archive of the result.

./gh-gl [-s] [-l level] [-t duration] user...

The -l option specifies the gzip compression level -2 <= l <= 9. -2 for Huffman
coding, -1 for a reasonable default level, otherwise 0 (none) <= l <= 9 (best).
The -t option specifies the timeout when cloning the git repo. The -s option
specifies to recursively clone submodules (with 16 parallel jobs).

If the downloads are interrupted, it will leave a folder in the /tmp directory.

Example execution on the users "esote", "git", and "torvalds" with a 1s
timeout (meaning large repos are skipped).
