gh-dl is a GitHub archiving client. It takes a list of names, which may be
users, organizations, or repositories, to create a compressed archive of the
result.

./gh-gl [-s] [-l level] [-t duration] name...

The -l option specifies the gzip compression level -2 <= l <= 9. -2 for Huffman
coding, -1 for a reasonable default level, otherwise 0 (none) <= l <= 9 (best).
The -t option specifies the timeout when cloning the git repo. The -s option
specifies to recursively clone submodules.

If the client is interrupted, it will leave a folder in the /tmp directory.

Example execution on the "esote" user, the "git" organization, and the
"golang/lint" repository, with a 30s timeout (meaning large repos are skipped).
